#### Authentication and Authorization Flow

This project uses JWT Authentication that is facilitated by an Express Backend.

Registered user's passwords are hashed before being entered into the Database. This is done using **Bcrypt**.

The `auth` middleware handles _token-creation_ using the `jsonwebtoken` library.

The Client stores the user's data in its Global state (Context API) and queries the `/api/auth/me` route to maintain the session on page reload. This is done with the help of a `Cookie`.

**Sign Up**

![Register]('/../documentation/register.png?raw=true')

**Login**

![Login]('/../documentation/login.png?raw=true')

The forms display custom `form-validation-error` messages. These messages are generated by the backend and sent as a `json` response.

![Validation]('/../documentation/formvalidation.png?raw=true')

**Account Details**

![Login]('/../documentation/account.png?raw=true')

#### Books for Purchase

The Books Layout are built using `flex-properties`.

![Books]('/../documentation/products.png?raw=true')

The Book's details are displayed in their own individual pages. This page is `Server-Side-Rendered`.

![BookDetail]('/../documentation/bookdetails.png?raw=true')

#### Cart

The Cart's state is globally managed.

![Cart]('/../documentation/cart.png?raw=true')

#### Payment

Payment is facilitated via Stripe.
The Backend server generates a `checkout-session-id` which the Next Client redirects the User to for payment.

![Login]('/../documentation/payment.png?raw=true')

#### Order History

Orders are stored for the user to view at any time.

![Login]('/../documentation/orders.png?raw=true')

#### Invoice Generation

The Invoice is generated for the specified order using PDFKit on the Client Side.
